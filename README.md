## Instructions

Dr. Mattox has been kidnapped by a group of goblins! He's been hidden somewhere in the house, and it's your job to find him. You have 72 hours until he is taken to the goblin realm and is gone for good, move quickly!

Some things to note:

-This house is not like most others. Each time you move to a different room, one hour passes. Remember, you must find Mattox within 72 hours or he will be gone for good!

-Beware of goblins. They want the superior intellect of Mattox for themselves, and will not let you have him without a fight.

-You have 100 health points, don't lose them or you will die!
